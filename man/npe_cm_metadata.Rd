\item{comm}{the community matrix object created by npe_community_matrix()}

}
\description{
The npe_community_matrix() function is designed to work with the vegan
package, and one of the requirements of vegan functions is that there are
only numeric columns in community matrices. Therefore, all of the metatdata
is collapsed into the rownames. This function allows you to extract that
very basic metadata back out to a more easily interpretable data frame.

data("D14")
npe_community_matrix(D14) |> npe_cm_metadata()
