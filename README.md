# neondiversity

This package contains scripts for processing plant species cover and occurrence data from NEON into more usable formats. The main functions are `vegify` which creates vegan-friendly species occurrence and abundance matrices, and `get_diversity_info`, which creates summary statistics by plot (or subplot) on the diversity, cover, relative cover, and number of species of natives, non-natives, and members of the family or species of your choosing.

# Installation Instructions

`devtools::install_github("admahood/neondiversity")`
